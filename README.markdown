`UT`
----

Mirror of Luc Hermitte's [`UT`][] unit testing addon.

Created mostly to facilitate use with [vim-addon-manager][];
see [issue 35][] for details.

This addon's dependency on Luc's [`lh-vim-lib`][] addon
has been linked to [a github mirror of that addon][vimlib-github].

This mirror was created simply by using `git-svn`.

There is no guarantee that it will be kept updated.
